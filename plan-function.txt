- Design
	- Input: LIRIS dataset:
				- Video
					- Subsample video: 5 fps --> C3D
					- Choose mid frame for feature --> Facenet
				- Audio
					- Feed to Soundnet
			** Load model va load parameter cua 3 model trong 1 chuong trinh
			
	- Output: Arousal-Valence score
				- Aurousal (float > 0)
				- Arousal  (float > 0)


- Extract feature C3D
	- foreach 16 group of image extract feature
		- number of image/ video not div by 16
			- take in convolution fashion from start till end
				- window size 16 conv from 0..n
			- split video based on folder containing it
				- split string by "/"
				- group by containing folder
				- foreach group 
					- convolution
					- output 4D tensor of w x h x 16 x color
					- add to list of tensors
					- video label = containing folder (to assign valence x arousal)
	- aim genrate multiple feature for a clip in liris
		-  
	- mark each feature with video name
